There are a bunch of scripts in the `tasks/` folder that can be useful:
* `tasks/format` formats all code
* `tasks/full-build` run everything that is run in the build pipe
* `tasks/generate-sumtypes` generates some code that shouldn't be edited manually
* `tasks/lock-dependencies` updates the lock file
